You can send UDP packets anywhere with this tool...
Just copy this file without .py extension to the bin folder, and use it.

how to use: udp [-d DESTINATION] [-p PORT] [-i INTENSITY]
for example: udp -d 10.0.2.5 -p 9685 -i 5
(of course it works fine with public ip addresses as well)

This tool is optimal for port-knocking.
